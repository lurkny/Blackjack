# Welcome to Blackjack!

This project is still under development, but I am welcoming all contributions! This contract will most likely live on the Sepolia testnet, because I don't have the time or money to actually run this contract on mainnet.

# Installation/Setup

1. Clone this repo into its own folder
2. Run npm install 

## Deployment
No script has been written to deploy this contract. If you want to make your own before I do, know that this contract **requires** both **ETH** an **LINK** to work.
